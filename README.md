These are some small scripts to create hotkeys for small tasks (such as encoding decoding).
To use these scripts

```
git clone https://github.com/meispi/shortcuts
```

create a batch script (.bat file) with these instructions
```
@echo off
python your\path\to\shortcuts\base64encode.py
```

create a shortcut of this .bat file in the same directory as the .bat file
